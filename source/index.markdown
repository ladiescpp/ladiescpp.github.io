## Who are we?
We are a womenâ€™s group for C++ programmers.

## What is our motive?
As women and as C++ers, we want to assemble women who have been using C++ for various purposes or have interest in C++. This is our honest endeavour to get women more closer to C++ by the means of our workshops, meetups, hackathons etc. Our event is a way to bring experts and beginners of C++ together so that they can share and learn at the same time.
